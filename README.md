# Overview

It's Flappy Bird! Seems kinda like a standard go-to for game recreation. It's simple, it's basic, and it made a ton of money in ad-revenue.

# Development Environment

This program was made in VSCode, and written in Python, primarily utilizing the pygame library. I'm sure it could be made with PyArcade, but I remembered pygame first so that's what got used!

   - This is where I got the Flappy Bird assets that I used, but I'm sure you can find other exact copies all over the internet.

# Future Work

* Music
* Pause Menu
